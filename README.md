# Image Captioning with DL

Using Tensorflow Xecption Image recognition model to do feature engineering on flicker8 dataset with descriptive captions of the images, using NLP teachings to do pre-processing and feature extraction. With Deep Learning we make a model on tensorflow with attention base model to give more important to context 
# Requirements
1) Tensorflow
2) Keras
3) numpy
4) pandas
5) Flask

# Objective

This model uses Attention mechanism to genrate a caption for a given Image. using Deep Learning Tensorflow library, numpy,NPL techniques 
# Datasets

Fliker8 is a collection for 
sentence-based image description and search, 
consisting of 8,000 images that are each paired with 
five different captions which provide clear descriptions of the salient entities and events
# What is attention mechanism
The Attention mechanism is a part of a neural architecture that enables to dynamically highlight relevant features of the input data, which, in NLP, is typically a sequence of textual elements. It can be applied directly to the raw input or to its higher level representation.
